What still needs to be done:
<!--
1. Add a way to send messages to the server
2. Add a way to receive messages from the server
3. Add a way to display messages in the UI (e.g., a chat with user names and timestamps as well as different day stamps)
4. Add a way to handle errors in message sending and receiving (Failed to send message!)
5. Add a way to handle message history (On local storage or on server)
6. Add a Main UI to display all messages from all users
